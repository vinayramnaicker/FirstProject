<h3>1.1.Web Evolution:</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">The web today is a growing universe of interlinked web pages and web apps, teeming with videos, photos and interactive content. 
What the average user doesn't see is the interplay of web technologies and browsers that makes all this possible. 
Over time, web technologies have evolved to give web developers the ability to create new generations of useful and immersive web experiences. 
Today's web is a result of the ongoing efforts of an open web community that helps define these web technologies, like HTML5, CSS3 and many more., </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Web 1.0 - static web Experts call the Internet before 1999 “Read-Only” web. The average internet user’s role was limited to reading the information 
which was presented to him. The best examples of this 1.0 web era are millions of static websites There was no active communication or information 
flow from consumer (of the information) to producer (of the information). </p>


<p style="text-align:justify">Web 2.0 - The writing and participating web The lack of active interaction of common users with the web leads to the birth of Web 2.0. This interaction and contribution has dramatically changed the landscape of the web […]. 
It has even more potential that we have yet to see.The Web 2.0 appears to be a welcome response to a web users demand to be more involved in what information is available to them. This era empowered the common user with a few new concepts like Blogs, 
Social-Media & Video-Streaming. Publishing your content is only a few clicks away! Few remarkable developments of Web 2.0 are Twitter, YouTube, Flickr and 
Facebook.</p>

<h3>1.2.1.Web Standards: </h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">Web standards are rules and guidelines established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) developed to promote consistency in
 the design code which makes up a web page. These are best-practice standards used by organizations to build web sites and web applications. </p>
 <h3>1.2.2Website: </h3>
 <p style="text-align:justify">A website is a collection of related web pages, including multimedia content, typically identified with a common domain name, 
 and published on at least one web server. A website may be accessible via a public Internet Protocol (IP) network, such as the Internet, 
 or a private local area network (LAN), by referencing a uniform resource locator (URL) that identifies the site. A collection of web pages 
 which are grouped together and usually connected together in various ways. Often called a "web site" or simply a "site."</p> 
 <h3>1.2.3.Web page: </h3>
 <p style="text-align:justify">A web page or web page is a document commonly written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) that is accessible 
 through the Internet or other network using an Internet browser. A web page is accessed by entering a URL address and may contain text, 
 graphics, and hyperlinks to other web pages and files. A web browser displays a web page on a monitor or mobile device. </p>

<h3>1.3.Tools used to develops: </h3>
<ul type="square">
<li>A computer. Maybe that sounds obvious to some people, but some of you are reading this article on your phone or a library computer. For serious web development, it's better to invest in a desktop or laptop computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux). </li>
<li>A text editor, to write code in. This could be a text editor (e.g. Sublime, Brackets, Atom or Visual Studio Code), or a hybrid editor (e.g. Dreamweaver or Web Storm). Office document editors are not suitable for this use, as they rely on hidden elements that interfere with the rendering engines used by web browsers. 
<li>Web browsers, to test code in. Currently, the most-used browsers are Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, Internet Explorer, and Microsoft Edge. You should also test how your site performs on mobile devices and on any old browsers your target audience may still be using (such as IE 8–10.)
<li>A graphics editor, like GIMP, Paint.NET, or Photoshop, to make images for your web pages. 
<li>A version control system, to manage files on servers, collaborates on a project with a team, share code and assets, and avoids editing conflicts. Right now Git is the most popular version control tool, and the GitHub code hosting service, based on Git, is also very popular. 
<li>An FTP program, used on older web hosting accounts to manage files on servers (Git is increasingly replacing FTP for this purpose). There are loads of (S)FTP programs available including Cyberduck, Fetch, and FileZilla.  
<li>An automation system like Grunt or Gulp to automatically perform repetitive tasks, such as minifying code and running tests. </li>
<li>Templates, libraries, frameworks, etc., to speed up writing common functionality </li>
</ul>
<h4>What structure should your website have? </h4>
<dl>
<dt style="color:#cc6600">index.html:</dt>
<dd> This file will generally contain your homepage content, that is, the text and images that people see when they first go to your site. 
</dd>
